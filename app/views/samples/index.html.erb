  <h1>School Days</h1><br>
    <p class="lead">The playground was an important part of childhood.  When you reflect on those days playing outside, what specific memories jump to mind?  Think about the sounds and the smells of the playground.  Visualize the area - draw a little map if it helps.  Write whatever comes to mind when thinking about being on the playground. Enjoy!</p><br>
